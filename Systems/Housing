Various structures can be bought. They come in different sizes and shapes. Other than the bedrooms and possibly one existing Room, renovations are needed to make the remaining rooms functionable.

Each Structure has a Room Limit or number rooms that it can support. Structures can always be expanded to support more rooms. Expansions are (2,500 GP + Room Cost) for a +1 to the Room Limit and takes 1d4 months to complete.

If you are building a structure from the ground up, then the pricing is a little different. Decide on a Room Limit, then the construction cost is (2,000 GP * Room Limit) + (Total Room Cost / 2) and the construction time is 1d6 months for each room.

Each Structure has a Land Limit. A Structure's Room Limit cannot go above a Structure's Land Limit. Land Limits are equal to a Structure's Room Limit when purchased. Land Limits can be expanded by purchasing neighboring land for 2 * Land Price. The Land Price is determined by where your Structure is built (ask your Realtor / DM).

Land can be bought in the countryside and is usually isolated from any other settlement. Land can be purchased for 1,000 GP, and it will usually have a Crime Chance of 5% and a Land Limit of 1,000.

Hirelings must be hired for maintenance while you are away. Otherwise, the structure is at risk of falling under disrepair and may be burglarized or vandalized.
  The number of skilled hirelings depends on the Constructed Rooms. (2 GP per week)
  The number of unskilled hirelings depends on the Room Limit. (2 SP per week)
        Room Limit      Required Amount of Unskilled Hirelings
          1 - 7           2^(Number of Rooms - 1).

          9+              100 + 50 * (Number of Rooms - 8)
  Armed hirelings can be hired to protect your structure.
    Guard          5 SP
    Scout          2 GP
    Thug           2 GP
    Spy            5 GP
    Berserker     10 GP

Rooms have a Room Size which is how much of the Room Limit is taken up by the Room.
Rooms can be remodled for the Room Cost and take 1d3 months to complete.
Rooms may have multiple levels. When upgrading to a higher level, subtract the old level's cost from the new level's cost. If you want to upgrade a Room further than described below, work with the DM.
Soom Rooms bring in weekly income.

Crime is a weekly random chance (unless your campaign actions result in some backlash against your Structure).
  Crime Chance: Location Crime Chance (ask Realator / DM)
                + Room Limit * 1%
                + Constructed Rooms * 1%
                + Additional Room Crime Modifiers

Protection provides creatures in a room with a +1 bonus from creatures outside the room (or wall / moat).
