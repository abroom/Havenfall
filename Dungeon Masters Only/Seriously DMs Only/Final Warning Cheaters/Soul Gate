Far west of Havenfall, there is an unmapped and magically hidden volcanic island. The island is only revealed if at least one of the Shards is within a mile. Of course this place is swarming with monsters that actively hunt and attack anyone who steps foot on the island. A path leads up the side of the Volcano and then into an entrance of an ornate temple made of obsidian. On the other side of the temple, an obsidian door opens into the center of the volcano. An obsidian path extends out to the middle of the rolling lava of the volcano. There appears to be another obsidian door at the end of the path.

This door has no handle, but it's obsidian frame has 8 slots for 8 shards.
Inscribed in LostTongue on the door is the following:
  12 Shards of A Fallen Star
  8 Souls Trapped Eternal
  4 Caged Powers Immortal
  Ruin Ahead

When all the shards are placed, the obsidian door crumbles (not the frame) and reveals a portal.
