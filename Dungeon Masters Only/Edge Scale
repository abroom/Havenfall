Edge is the measurment of how dark and gritty the game will be, how close the game approaches the line of the cliff before it falls off into the deep end into crazytown without a parachute. This level is agreed upon by the players and DM, so everyone is comfortable and having fun.

Edge Level is the sum of the Edge Points. This is just some random metric which is absolutely pointless to the game.

Pick what is permitted and what is forbidden in the game.


Breaking the agreed upon Edge is serious because you risk ruining someone's fun. And then probably your own fun, since you will be asked to leave the group or the group will break apart.
