Swanland

The SwanKing has been hunting all non-humans in his realm and burning them alive to purify their evil heresey by the power of Lionnel. Recently, he has also been sacrificing disident humans and criminals. Even minor offenses are met with death.

The closed borders also prevent anyone from leaving.
Speaking with the guards, there is a program to apply to become a citizen. A test is given and interrogation, making sure people are commoners and are ready to spend the rest of their lives in Swanland. It asks who they keep in regular contact who lives outside of Swanland.
  Possibly the test was not 100% successful. There could be an NPC looking to hire some Tattered Cloaks to gain acces to Swanland to find their cousin who stopped sending letters after moving to Swanland.
The migrants who enter are then dropped off in a large town. However without special permits, it is illeagal to rent rooms or offer accomodation to new-citizens. Those with special permits charge exorbitatnt fees. Many new-citizens end up on the streets, which is also illeagal. They are quickly arrested and never seen again. 

Besides the mass burning of criminals. Many of them just seem to disappear (especially women and children).
Turns out, he is using slave labor to build an ornate and massive temple in the old Dwarven Ruins that lay beneath the Mountains.

Obviously, fire makes ash, and the dude is a worshiper of Rakrak.
